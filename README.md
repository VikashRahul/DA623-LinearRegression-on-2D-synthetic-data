# DA623-LinearRegression-on-synthetic-dataset
This repository is for DA623: Computing with Signals course project. It contains a tutorial demonstrating the linear regression on a 2D synthetic dataset.

# Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The tutorial firsts synthetically creates a 2D dataset and build a linear regression model for it and also explores the effect of outliers on the accuracy of the model. It tries to visualise the concept of overfitting and underfitting as well.
